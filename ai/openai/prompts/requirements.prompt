Your goal to extract functional requirements and backend API from the design document below.

Your output should be a JSON object. It should have two fields: "requirements" and "server_api".

"requirements" should be a list of one-sentence functional requirements.
"server_api" should be a list of HTTP paths to update state on the server

The server api MUST include both read and write endpoints for all requirements.

Here is the design document:
{{ user_requirements }}
